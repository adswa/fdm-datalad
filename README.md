This server has been set up prior to the start of the workshop,
for ease of use and to minimize delays. Its has all required
software pre-installed so there is no need for participants to
prepare at all.

All you have to do is log in to the server at the start of the workshop
(selecting a username and password on first signup) and start using it.
